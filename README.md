<h2>Cryptography</h2>

&emsp;About this Repo: This repository is dedicated to cryptography. My intention is to familiarize myself with cybersecurity concepts, and cryptography plays an essential role in this field. Being a fundamental sector, I have decided to start with the oldest algorithms and advance to the most modern ones, implementing them in two of the most widely used programming languages at present, which are also considered memory-safe.
<br>&emsp;Thank you for taking the time to review this GitHub repository. 
<br>&emsp;I appreciate your interest in my work. ðŸ™‚
